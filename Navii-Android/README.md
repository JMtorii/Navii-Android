Useful Libraries
-----------------
Before implementing a new custom view or special features, please check out https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries. This link has a lot of useful components, views, animations, and helper classes. Be careful of the libraries that haven't been updated in the past few months though. Check the module settings to see what libaries are currently being implemented.
